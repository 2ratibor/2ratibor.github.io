MiniGame

This is a mini game. The rules are following:
You should put in the field the delay between steps (count of milliseconds) and press "Start" button. After that on the screen will appear yellow squares. User should have time to click by the yellow square till the square does not change color to red. If user have time to click by yellow square, the square will change color to green. You need 10 green squares for win in the game. First time I recommend you set a delay value as 1000 and change it each next try according to your agility. Good luck.
